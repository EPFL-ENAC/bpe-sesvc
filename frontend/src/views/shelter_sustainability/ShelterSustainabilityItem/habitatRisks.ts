    description:
      "Aluminium production involves relatively larges amounts of mineral bauxite mining/extraction, which is associated with larges amounts of unused residues (<a href='https://www.greenspec.co.uk/building-design/aluminium-production-environmental-impact/' target='_blank'>Greenspec, 2022</a>). Primary mining areas for bauxite are Australia, China, Brazil and India. Primary production of aluminium is highly energy intensive - requiring around 211 GJ per tonne of aluminium, compared to 22.7GJ per tonne for steel (<a href='https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP12183&dsid=DS3' target='_blank'>CSIRO, 2021</a>). However, around a third of all aluminium production globally comes from reuse of scrap from manufacturing and from recycling (<a href='https://www.iea.org/reports/aluminium' target='_blank'>IEA, 2022</a>).",

    description:
      "Bamboo is widely associated with less harmful environmental impacts in comparison with other structural framing materials such as timber or steel. However, total quantities of bamboo use should be taken into account with regard to numbers of shelters to be provided. Poorly managed bamboo extraction can contribute to erosion (<a href='https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/an-environmental-guide-to-building-material-selection-and-use' target='_blank'>WWF, 2016 [Building Material Selection - An environmental guide]</a>). Bamboo has relatively short harvest cycles of around 4-6 years. Bamboo growth is associated with extensive irrigation, however bamboo plantations typically rely on rainfall in tropical climates.",

      "Canvas and polycotton production derives from cotton cultivation, which is associated with high water use for irrigation and extensive use of pesticides (US Dept of Agriculture, 2020 [U.S. Department of Agriculture (2020a) 2019 Agricultural chemical use survey: cotton. NASS Highlights. No. 2020-3.]. Polycotton contains polyester, which uses less water in production compared to natural fibres, though invovles relatively energy intensive production - around 125MJ per kg (Muthu, S.S., 2020. Assessing the environmental impact of textiles and the clothing supply chain. Woodhead publishing.)",

More than half of global cement production occurs in China ((<a href='https://www.iea.org/reports/cement' target='_blank'>IEA, 2022</a>). Clinker production - a principal component of cement production - is energy intensive, involving around 3.5GJ of energy per tonne of clinker ((<a href='https://www.iea.org/reports/cement' target='_blank'>IEA, 2022</a>).",
