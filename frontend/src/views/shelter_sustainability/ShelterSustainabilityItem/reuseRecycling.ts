      "Aluminium composite panels have good potential for reuse, depending on the manner of installation and use. Composite panels are typically used for external cladding of walls and roofs. Panels are potentially durable given that aluminium outer layers, and polymer inner layers of composite panels do not readily degrade in natural conditions. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal; thus, design and installation for reuse should minimize the potential for damage by abrasion and impact. Design for reuse should aim to maintain standard sheet dimensions (i.e., minimize cutting) and minimize damage from installation and fixing. Aluminium composite panels have poor potential for recycling, given that bonding between aluminium and polymer layers hampers the separation of the materials after use.",

      "Aluminium sheet has good potential for reuse, depending on the manner of installation and use. Aluminium sheet is typically used for external cladding of walls and roofs, specifically as waterproofing and flashing elements that provide a waterproof layer at joints between cladding panels. Aluminium is potentially durable given that it does not readily degrade in natural conditions. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal; thus, design and installation for reuse should minimize the potential for damage by abrasion and impact. Aluminium flashing and other waterproofing elements are typically relatively small in size and cut/bent to suit specific applications, which reduces the potential for reuse. Aluminium is readily recycled with no loss of its mechanical properties; thus, aluminium scrap has a relatively high value for collectors compared to other building waste.",

      "Bamboo poles have good potential for reuse, depending on the manner of installation, use, and connections employed. Bamboo degrades in consistent moist/wet conditions; however, structural applications of bamboo poles typically do not entail consistent exposure to wet conditions. The fibrous composition of bamboo is such that connections and joints should avoid cutting, drilling, nailing, or screwing. Thus, bamboo poles designed for reuse should include jointing methods that minimize damage, for example, by utilizing joint designs that rely on tying, clamping, screwing, or nailing. Bamboo poles can be recycled by splitting poles for use in woven panels or by extracting fibers for textiles and other uses. Given the additional processing requirements of recycling applications, the value of bamboo poles in reuse is potentially greater than the recycled value.",
