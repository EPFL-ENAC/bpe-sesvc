      "Aluminium composite panels have good potential for reuse, depending on the manner of installation and use. Composite panels are typically used for external cladding of walls and roofs. Panels are potentially durable given that aluminium outer layers and polymer inner layers of composite panels do not readily degrade in natural conditions. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal thus design and installation for reuse should minimise the potential for damage by abrasion and impact. Design for reuse should aim to maintain standard sheet dimensions (i.e., minimise cutting) and minimize damage from installation and fixing. Aluminium composite panels have poor potential for recycling, given that bonding between aluminium nad polymer layers hampers separation of the materials after use.",

      "Aluminium sheet has good moderate for reuse, depending on the manner of installation and use. Aluminium sheet is typically used for external cladding of walls and roofs, specifically as waterproofing and flashing elements that provide a waterproof layer at joints between cladding panels. Aluminium is potentially durable given that it does not readily degrade in natural conditions. Aluminium is a relatively soft metal thus design and installation for reuse should minimise the potential for damage by abrasion and impact. Aluminium flashing and other waterproofing elements are typically relatively small in size and cut/bent to suit specific applications, which reduces potential for reuse. Aluminium is readily recycled, thus aluminium scrap has relatively high value compared to other building waste.",

Aluminium window frames and door frames are potentially durable. To optimise reuse potential, design should maintain standard dimensions and installation should minimise damage to the frames and provide for removal.

      "Bamboo poles have good potential for reuse, depending on the manner of installation and use. Bamboo degrades in consistent moist/wet conditions, however structural applications of bamboo poles typically do not  entail consistent exposure to we conditions. The fibrous composition of bamboo is such that connections and joints should avoid cutting, drilling, nailing, screwing etc. Thus design for bamboo and design for reuse should include jointing methods that minimise damage, for example by utilising joint designs that rely on tying, clamping, etc. Bamboo poles can be recycled, for example by splitting poles for use in woven panels or by extracting fibres for textiles and other uses. Given additional processing requirements of recycling applications, value of bamboo poles in reuse is potentially greater than value recycled value.",

Design for reuse of tarpaulins should avoid cutting and puncturing and should utilise standard reinforced grommet holes for fixing.
